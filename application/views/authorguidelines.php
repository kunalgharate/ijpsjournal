                            <h5>Manuscript Format</h5>

                            <p class="middle">The preferred format of all manuscript is MS Word. Illustrations (figures) and images must be inserted in the manuscript at the position they should appear when published.</p>

                            <h5>Preparation of Manuscript</h5>

<p class="middle">
Mode of Presenting Paper is English. Each manuscript should be typed single-spaced on A4 (8.5″ × 11″) paper size with 1 inch margins. It should be arranged in the following order: Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgement and References.</p>

<h5>Title Page</h5>

<p class="middle">Title page should contain title of the paper in bold face, title case (font size 14), names of the authors in normal face, upper case (font size 12) followed by the address in normal face lower case. The author to whom all correspondence be addressed should be denoted by an asterisk mark. The title should be as short as possible and precisely indicate the nature of the work in the communication. Names of the authors should appear as initials followed by surnames. At the bottom left corner of the title page, please mention “*Address For correspondence” and provide a functional e-mail address. Address of the corresponding author to whom all correspondence may be sent should be given only if it is different from the address already given under authors’ names.</p>

<h5>Abstract</h5>

<p class="middle">Should start on a new page after the title page and should be typed in single-space to distinguish it from the Introduction. Abstracts should briefly reflect all aspects of the study, as most databases list mainly abstracts. The manuscript should have an abstract 150- 250 words.</p>

<h5>Keywords</h5>

<p class="middle">
Provide four to six appropriate key words after abstract</p>

<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p class="middle">A short introduction of the research problem followed by a brief review of literature and objective of the research.</p>

<h5>Materials and Methods</h5>

<p class="middle">Describe the materials used in the experiment, year of experimentation, site etc. Describe the methods implied for collection of data in short.</p>

<h5>Results and Discussion</h5>

<p class="middle">This segment should focus on the fulfillment of  stated objectives as given in the introduction. It should contain the findings presented in the form of tables, figures and photographs.</p>

<h5>References</h5>

<p class="middle">Should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text (not in alphabetic order). Identify references in text, tables and legends by Arabic numerals in superscript. References cited only in tables or figure legends should be numbered in accordance with the sequence established by the first identification in the text of the particular table or figure.</p>


<h5>Journal Articles</h5>

<p class="middle">Shashi A, Jain SK and Pandey M: In-vitro evaluation of antilthiatic activity of seeds of Dolichos biflorus and roots of Asparagus racemosus . International Journal of Plant Sciences 2008; 1:67-71.</p>


<h5>A Book</h5>

<p class="middle">Kalia AN: A Text Book of Industrial Pharmacognosy. CBS Publishers & Distributors, First Edition 2005.</p>


<h5>A Chapter in a Book</h5>

<p class="middle">Nadkarni KM: Indian Materia Medica. Popular Prakashan, Mumbai, Edition 3, Vol. I, 2000: 242-246.</p>


<h5>Illustrations</h5>

<p class="middle">All the tables and figures should be in the text at suitable place. Only MS word table format should be used for preparing tables. Tables should show lines separating rows but not those separating columns. Tables should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals and bear a brief title in capital letters normal face. Tables should not be very large that they run more than one A4 sized page.</p>


<h5>Abbreviations, Units Etc</h5>

<p class="middle">The journal strictly follows the rules defined in the IUPAC Manual of symbols and terminology for physicochemical quantities and units.</p>


<h5>Short Communication</h5>

<p class="middle">The journal publishes exciting findings, preliminary data or studies that did not yield enough information to make a full paper as short communications. These have the same format requirements as full papers but are only up to 10 pages in length in total. Short Communications should not have subtitles such as Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion- all these have to be merged into the running text. Short Communications preferably should have only 3-4 illustrations.</p>


<h5>Review Article</h5>

<p class="middle">Should be about 15-30 pages long, contain up-to-date information, comprehensively cover relevant literature and preferably be written by scientists who have in-depth knowledge on the topic. All format requirements are same as those applicable to full papers.</p>


<h5>Submission of Manuscript</h5>

<p class="middle">All manuscripts (must be in English and in MS Word format) and should be submitted via our online system or through e-mail at editorijpsr@gmail.com / ijpsronline@gmail.com as an attachment for quick evaluation .</p>

Authors would be required to sign a form (to be supplied by the Editor) transferring copyright before the manuscript can be published.</p>


<h5>Ethical matter</h5>

<p class="middle">Authors publishing results from in vivo experiments involving animals or humans should state whether due permission for conduction of these experiments was obtained, from the relevant ethics committees, in the Materials and Methods section. In addition, authors wishing to publish research work involving human studies should also send a notary verified letter of approval from the Ethics Committee or the Institutional Review Board.</p>



<h5>Conflicts of Interest</h5>

<p class="middle">All authors of submitting manuscript to the journal must disclose any and all conflicts of interest they may have with publication of the manuscript that is mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
