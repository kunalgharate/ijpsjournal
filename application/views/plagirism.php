    <h1><b>Plagiarism Policy</b></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Taking the ideas and work of others without giving them credit is unfair and dishonest. Copying even one sentence from someone elseâ€™s manuscript, or even one of your own that has previously been published, without proper citation is considered plagiarism-use your own words instead.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Authors should ensure the originality of their contents, while preparing a manuscript draft. In case the authors have used the work and/or words of others this must be appropriately cited or quoted. All the articles submitted to IJPSDR shall be screened for plagiarism. In case, plagiarism is detected during review/editorial process, such manuscript(s) will be rejected immediately. If the plagiarism is proven after publication, such manuscript(s) will be retracted from the journal and appropriate announcement will be placed in this regards. We can also consider appropriate action against authors depending upon the seriousness of the case. It includes debarring the authors from publication in future. We can bring such instants in notice of author's funding agencies, author's institutes (where they works) and to the original authors whose work has been plagiarized.</p>
